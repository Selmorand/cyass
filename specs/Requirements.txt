================================================================================
                            BROWSER REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

ANDROID DEVICES
---------------
  Recommended: Google Chrome (version 90+)

  - Chrome provides the best PWA experience
  - Accept the "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen" prompt when it appears
  - Samsung Internet browser also works well

iPHONE / iPAD
-------------
  Required: Safari (built-in browser)

  IMPORTANT: You MUST add CYAss to your Home Screen for full functionality!

  Without adding to Home Screen:
    - You may be logged out every 7 days
    - Cached data may be cleared by the system
    - No offline access to saved reports

  How to Add to Home Screen (iPhone):
    1. Open CYAss in Safari
    2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
    3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
    4. Tap "Add" to confirm

NOT RECOMMENDED
---------------
  - Firefox (limited PWA support)
  - Opera (untested)
  - In-app browsers (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram)

================================================================================
                          IMPORTANT: IN-APP BROWSERS
================================================================================

  DO NOT open CYAss from links inside these apps:

    - WhatsApp
    - Facebook / Facebook Messenger
    - Instagram
    - LinkedIn
    - Twitter/X
    - Email apps

  These apps use built-in browsers with limited functionality:
    - Camera access may be blocked
    - Login sessions may not save
    - PWA features are disabled

  SOLUTION: Copy the CYAss link and paste it into Chrome or Safari directly.

================================================================================
                         PWA INSTALLATION (RECOMMENDED)
================================================================================

CYAss works best when installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

Benefits of Installing:
  - App icon on your home screen
  - Faster loading times
  - Better session persistence (stay logged in)
  - Full-screen experience (no browser bars)
  - Reliable camera and storage access

HOW TO INSTALL:

  Android (Chrome):
    1. Open CYAss website in Chrome
    2. Look for "Install App" banner or menu option
    3. Alternatively: Menu (3 dots) > "Add to Home Screen"
    4. Tap "Install" or "Add"

  iPhone (Safari):
    1. Open CYAss website in Safari (not Chrome!)
    2. Tap the Share button (square with up arrow)
    3. Scroll down, tap "Add to Home Screen"
    4. Tap "Add" in the top right

================================================================================
                              VIDEO RECORDING
================================================================================

For best video quality during room walkthroughs:

  - Use a device with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)
  - Hold the phone steady with both hands
  - Move slowly and smoothly
  - Ensure good lighting
  - Maximum recording time: 1 minute per room
  - Maximum file size: 50MB per video

Devices WITHOUT OIS may produce shaky/jittery video. This is a hardware
limitation, not an app issue.

================================================================================
                              PHOTO CAPTURE
================================================================================

Tips for best photo quality:

  - Ensure adequate lighting
  - Hold steady when capturing
  - Photos are automatically compressed for fast uploads
  - Multiple photos can be taken per inspection item
  - Rear camera is used by default

================================================================================
                            KNOWN LIMITATIONS
